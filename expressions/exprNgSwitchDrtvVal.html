	*************Code Explanation***********

	ng-switch attaches a listener for changes in the value of the "on" attribute.
	However just before ng-switch can add that listener, AngularJS gives the 
	attribute value to expressionEvaluator considering that the value is written
	inside {{}}.

	Note:  The piece of code which takes care of dynamic replacement of text 
	written inside {{}}	is called "interpolation service". Interpolation service 
	removes text along with	{{}} from the tag or attribute and replaces the tag 
	or attribute with the actual value later.

	So in this code "interpolation service" will remove the value "{{emailPlaceholder}}"
	from ng-switch. When ng-switch tries to add a change listener to "on" attribute's
	value it will not be able to do so because "{{emailPlaceHolder}}" is removed by
	"interpolation service".

	Note: Once mainCtrl is invoked "interpolation service" replaces {{emailPlaceholder}}
	with "main@example.com". But by that its too late since ng-switch had failed
	to add value change listener and will never get to know that {{emailPlaceholder}}
	is replaced.
	====================================================================== -->
	<div ng-switch on="{{emailPlaceholder}}">
		<p ng-switch-when="mail@example.com"> mail@example.com </p>
		<p ng-switch-default> Default case</p>
	</div>
