		<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" ng-app>
			<p> This part of code is processed by AngularJS because it is the first
			    element in the DOM for which ng-app is declared.

			<p> {{'Do you know that 1 + 1 = ' + (1+1) }}</p>
			
			<div style="border: 1px dotted black; padding:10px; margin: 5px;" ng-app>
				<p> The 'ng-app' in this section is ignored by AngularJS since 
				it has already found 'ng-app' declaration above. However this 
				part of code is still processed by AngularJS because it is 
				under the DOM element for which the first 'ng-app' was declared</p>

		<!---------------------------------->
		<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" ng-app>
			<p> Declaring ng-app twice is not of any use. As soon as AngularJS finds 
			first declaration of 'ng-app' it ignores others  </p>
			<p> {{'Do you know that 1 + 1 = ' + (1+1) }}</p>
		</div><br/><br/>
		<!---------------------------------->
		<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
			<p> AngularJS doesn't care about this piece of code because there is 
			no ng-app declaration for it</p>
			<p> {{'Do you know that 1 + 1 = ' + (1+1) }}</p>
