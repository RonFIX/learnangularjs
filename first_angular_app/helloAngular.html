			<p> This part of code is processed by AngularJS </p>
			<p> {{'Do you know that 1 + 1 = ' + (1+1) }}</p>
			
			<div ng-app>
				<p> The 'ng-app' in this section is ignored by AngularJS since it has already 
				found 'ng-app' declaration above. However this part of code is still processed 
				by AngularJS because it is under the DOM element for which the first 'ng-app' was declared</p>
				<p> {{'Do you know that 1 + 1 = ' + (1+1) }}</p>
			</div>
		</div><br/><br/>
		<!---------------------------------->
		<div ng-app>
			<p> Declaring ng-app twice is not of any use. As soon as AngularJS finds 
			first declaration of 'ng-app' it ignores others  </p>
			<p> {{'Do you know that 1 + 1 = ' + (1+1) }}</p>
		</div><br/><br/>
		<!---------------------------------->
		<div>
			<p> AngularJS doesn't care about this piece of code because there is 
			no ng-app declaration for it</p>
			<p> {{'Do you know that 1 + 1 = ' + (1+1) }}</p>
